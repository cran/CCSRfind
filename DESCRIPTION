Description: Provides a tool for matching ICD-10 codes to corresponding Clinical Classification Software Refined (CCSR) codes. The main function, CCSRfind(), identifies each CCSR code that applies to an individual given their diagnosis codes. It also provides a summary of CCSR codes that are matched to a dataset. The package contains 3 datasets: 'DXCCSR' (mapping of ICD-10 codes to CCSR codes), 'Legend' (conversion of DXCCSR to CCSRfind-usable format for CCSR codes with less than or equal to 1000 ICD-10 diagnosis codes), and 'LegendExtend' (conversion of DXCCSR to CCSRfind-usable format for CCSR codes with more than 1000 ICD-10 dx codes). The disc() function applies grepl() ('base') to multiple columns and is used in CCSRfind().
